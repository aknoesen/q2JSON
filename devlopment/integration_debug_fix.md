## **Problem: Function Conflict**

The app.py still has the old `repair_json_string()` function, but the modular processor is calling `get_repair_function()` which should use the enhanced repair.

## **Quick Fix 1: Remove Old Function**

In app.py, DELETE the entire `repair_json_string()` function (lines 8-70). 

The modular processor has its own enhanced repair functions.

## **Quick Fix 2: Verify Import**

Make sure this line is correctly at the top:
```python
from modules.json_processor import JSONProcessor
```

## **Quick Fix 3: Test Direct Call**

Add this debug line in Stage 3 (temporary) to see what's happening:

```python
# DEBUG: Test the repair function directly
st.write("DEBUG: Testing repair function...")
from modules.llm_repairs import repair_chatgpt_response
test_repair = repair_chatgpt_response(raw_json[:200])
st.write(f"Repair test result: {len(test_repair)} chars")
```

## **Expected Issue**

The modular processor is probably calling the wrong repair function. The integration should be using the enhanced repair from `modules/llm_repairs.py`, not the old one in app.py.

## **Immediate Action**

1. Delete the old `repair_json_string()` function from app.py
2. Restart the Streamlit app
3. Test again

The modular processor should then use its own enhanced repair functions.
