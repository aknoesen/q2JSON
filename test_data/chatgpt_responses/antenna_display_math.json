      "question_text": "A rectangular patch antenna is designed to radiate primarily in the broadside direction. If the patch is oriented such that its length is along the x-axis and its width along the y-axis on a PCB, what is the typical polarization of the radiated field?",
      "choices": [
        "Circular Polarization",
        "Vertical Polarization (along the z-axis)",
        "Horizontal Polarization (along the x-axis)",
        "Linear Polarization (along the y-axis)"

      "points": 1,
      "tolerance": 0.05,
      "feedback_correct": "Correct. The polarization of a rectangular patch antenna is typically linear and aligned with the direction of the current flow. In this case, with the patch width along the y-axis, the primary current flow and thus the polarization will be along the y-axis.",
      "feedback_incorrect": "Incorrect. The polarization is determined by the current distribution on the patch. Consider which direction the current predominantly flows along the width of the patch.",

The reflection coefficient is: $$\Gamma = \frac{75 + j10 - 50}{75 + j10 + 50} = \frac{25 + j10}{125 + j10}$$. $$|\Gamma| = \frac{\sqrt{25^2 + 10^2}}{\sqrt{125^2 + 10^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{725}}{\sqrt{15725}} \approx 0.215$$.
