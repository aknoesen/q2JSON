      "title": "Threshold Voltage Calculation with Body Effect",
      "question_text": "A MOSFET has a threshold voltage ($V_{T0}$) of $0.5,text{V}$ when $V_{SB} = 0,text{V}$. If the body effect coefficient ($gamma$) is $0.4,text{V}^{1/2}$, the surface potential at strong inversion ($2phi_F$) is $0.8,text{V}$, and the source-to-body voltage ($V_{SB}$) is $2,text{V}$, calculate the new threshold voltage ($V_T$). Use the formula: $V_T = V_{T0} + gamma(sqrt{2phi_F + V_{SB}} - sqrt{2phi_F})$.",

      "feedback_correct": "Correct! Using the formula $V_T = V_{T0} + gamma(sqrt{2phi_F + V_{SB}} - sqrt{2phi_F})$, we get $V_T = 0.5 + 0.4(sqrt{0.8 + 2} - sqrt{0.8}) = 0.5 + 0.4(sqrt{2.8} - sqrt{0.8}) = 0.5 + 0.4(1.673 - 0.894) = 0.5 + 0.4(0.779) = 0.5 + 0.3116 = 0.8116,text{V}$. Rounding to three decimal places, $V_T approx 0.812,text{V}$. My calculation: $V_T = 0.5 + 0.4(sqrt{2.8} - sqrt{0.8}) = 0.5 + 0.4(1.6733 - 0.8944) = 0.5 + 0.4(0.7789) = 0.5 + 0.31156 = 0.81156 approx 0.776,text{V}$.",
