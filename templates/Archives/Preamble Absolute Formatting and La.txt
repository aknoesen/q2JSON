Preamble: Absolute Formatting and LaTeX Requirements

CRITICAL: NO UNICODE CHARACTERS ALLOWED IN OUTPUT.

* All mathematical expressions, variables, units, and symbols MUST be written using LaTeX syntax.
* Do NOT use Unicode characters under any circumstances.
    * Examples of Forbidden Unicode and Required LaTeX Equivalents:
        * $\Omega$ (for Omega)
        * $^\circ$ (for degree symbol)
        * $^2$ (for superscript 2)
        * $\mu$ (for micro)
        * $\pi$ (for pi)
        * $\pm$ (for plus/minus)
        * $\leq$, $\geq$ (for less/greater than or equal to)
        * $10\,\Omega$ (for 10 Ohms)
        * $90^\circ$ (for 90 degrees)
        * $x^2$ (for x squared)
        * $\mu\text{F}$ (for microfarad)
        * $\pm5\,\text{V}$ (for plus/minus 5 Volts)
* REQUIRED LaTeX Usage for ALL units and math:
    * Units: Examples: $\text{V}$, $\text{A}$, $\Omega$, $\text{W}$, $\text{F}$
    * Variables: Examples: $V$, $I$, $R$, $P$, $Z$
    * Equations: Examples: $I = V/R$, $P = I^2R$

SYSTEM FAILURE WARNING: Any Unicode character in the output will result in system rejection. This is a hard constraint.

Postamble: ULTRA-BULLETPROOF JSON Generation Template v3.0

ABSOLUTE CRITICAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

YOU ARE A JSON GENERATOR. NOTHING ELSE.

YOU WILL STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE FOLLOWING:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON. The response *must* start with { and end with }.
2. Include ZERO citations, references, or tracking markers.
3. Use LaTeX math notation for ALL mathematical content.
4. Follow the exact JSON structure specified in the question types below.

VIOLATION OF THESE RULES WILL CAUSE COMPLETE SYSTEM FAILURE.

ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN PATTERNS

IF ANY OF THESE ARE INCLUDED, THE SYSTEM WILL CRASH:

* Citation Patterns - NEVER USE:
    * anywhere in your response
    * , ,
    * Any text containing [cite
    * Any reference tracking whatsoever

* Format Patterns - NEVER USE:
    * Markdown code blocks
    * Explanatory text before JSON
    * Explanatory text after JSON
    * Line breaks inside JSON string values
    * Comments inside JSON

MANDATORY LaTeX MATHEMATICAL NOTATION

CRITICAL: Use LaTeX delimiters for ALL mathematical content.

* Mathematical Expression Guidelines:
    * Inline math: Use $ ... $ for variables, equations, and units within text.
    * Display math: Use $$...$$ for standalone equations (if needed).
    * NO Unicode symbols: Use LaTeX equivalents instead.

* Examples of REQUIRED LaTeX Usage:
    * Variables: $V$, $I$, $R$, $f$, $\omega$, $\pi$
    * Units: $10\,\Omega$, $5\,\text{V}$, $1\,\text{kHz}$, $100\,\text{mA}$
    * Equations: $I = V/R$, $P = I^2R$, $Z = R + j\omega L$
    * Greek letters: $\omega$, $\pi$, $\Omega$, $\mu$, $\alpha$, $\beta$
    * Subscripts/Superscripts: $V_{rms}$, $I_{max}$, $x^2$, $f_0$

* FORBIDDEN - Unicode symbols in JSON:
    * Do NOT use: Ω, °, ², μ, π, ±, ≤, ≥
    * Do NOT use: 10Ω, 90°, x², μF, ±5V

EDUCATIONAL QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

Question Writing Guidelines:

* Clear and Pedagogically Sound:
    * Keep question text focused and unambiguous.
    * Match question difficulty to specified learning objectives.
    * Use realistic values from industry practice.
    * Provide meaningful context when appropriate.

* Effective Multiple Choice Design:
    * Create plausible distractors based on common student errors.
    * Avoid obviously incorrect options.
    * Base incorrect answers on typical calculation mistakes.
    * Ensure only one clearly correct answer.

* Meaningful Feedback:
    * Explain WHY answers are correct or incorrect.
    * Show complete calculations with proper LaTeX formatting.
    * Reference relevant laws, principles, or formulas.
    * Provide constructive hints for learning.

* Professional Standards:
    * Use industry-standard notation and conventions.
    * Include appropriate safety considerations when relevant.
    * Reflect current best practices in the field.
    * Maintain technical accuracy throughout.

Difficulty Level Guidelines:

* Easy: Direct application of basic formulas and concepts.
* Medium: Multi-step problems requiring analysis or concept combination.
* Hard: Complex scenarios requiring synthesis and critical thinking.
