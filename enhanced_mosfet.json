      "points": 1,
      "tolerance": 0.05,
      "feedback_correct": "Correct! Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) causes the drain depletion region to extend into the channel, effectively reducing the barrier for electron injection from the source and thus lowering $V_{th}$.",
      "feedback_incorrect": "DIBL is the primary short channel effect that causes a reduction in the threshold voltage due to the proximity of the drain and source depletion regions in very short channels.",

        "It causes $I_D$ to increase linearly with $V_{DS}$ in saturation.",
        "It leads to a sublinear increase in $I_D$ with increasing $V_{GS}$.",

      "feedback_correct": "Correct! Velocity saturation occurs when carriers reach their maximum drift velocity, meaning further increases in the electric field (due to $V_{DS}$) do not significantly increase their velocity, thus limiting $I_D$.",
